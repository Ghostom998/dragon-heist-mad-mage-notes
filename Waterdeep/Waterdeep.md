# Waterdeep

As a long-time resident of Waterdeep, I will have pre-existing knowledge of most things a local would, maybe more due to my bookishness.

## The Politics of Waterdeep

- Waterdeep has many noble families. For a list, see [[Noble Houses]].
- Waterdeep is governed by many lords: one Open Lord, and a council of secret lords.
  - The total number of secret lords and their identities are unknown, even to each other. This is to prevent things such as bribery and threats.
  - The Open Lord's identity is known to the rest of the council and the public.
  - The secret lords' identities are known to the Open Lord.

## History

- There have been three major "apocalyptic" scenarios in Waterdeep's history:
    - [[The Time of Troubles]]
    - [[The Spellplague]]
    - [[The Sundering]]

## Daily Life

- Most people don't walk around with weapons and armour.
  - Those who do are either nobles, their militia, or hired guards.
  - If you walk around in town openly carrying weaponry, you'd seem quite violent and dangerous.
- The town is protected by the City Guard and the City Watch.
  - The City Guard patrol the roads leading to town, while the City Watch police the citizens within the walls.
  - Calling a watchman a guard *will* make you look like a gaijin, and vice versa.
