# Waterdeep
As a long-time resident of Waterdeep, I will have pre-existing knowledge of most things a local would, maybe more due to my bookishness.

- There are multiple Secret Lords, the total number and their identities unknown even to each other, but only one Open Lord. He is of similar power to the others, but is known publicly, and knows the Secret Lords.
- Remember the three apocalyptic periods
	- [The Time of Troubles](The%20Time%20of%20Troubles.md)
	- [The Spellplague](The%20Spellplague.md)
	- [The Sundering](The%20Sundering.md)
- Most people don't walk around with weapons and armour, which is an oddity compared to other rough-and-tumble towns in the north. You'd look a little violent if you did.
- Calling a watchman a guard makes you look like a gaijin, because the City Guard patrol the roads leading to town, while the City Watch protect the citizens.
