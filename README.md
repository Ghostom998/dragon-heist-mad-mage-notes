# Dragon Heist / Dungeon of the Mad Mage Notes

Some notes on our DnD campaign. To be chronicled by up-and-coming writer, Serge Meridian, tutor, scholar, great mind, and humble resident of the City of Splendours.

You might be wondering if these notes are written in-character or as reference for the players. The answer is yes... and no... to both.
