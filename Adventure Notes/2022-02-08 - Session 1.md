# Session 1
## Bar Fight and Troll Encounter
- Leon helped stand between Yagra and her agressors in the Yawning Portal
- A troll and stirges came out of the pit, making most customers flee
- Durnan draws a greatsword and immediately engages in combat
- A great deal of fire by the way of Burning Hands from Serge takes the troll down

## Meeting with Volo
- Volo has lost his friend called Floon Blagmaar:
	- Handsome male
	- Mid 30s
	- Wavy red hair
	- Not the brightest
- Went missing 2 nights ago
- Was wearing princely garb
- Volo left him in the pub by himself

## On the way to the Pub
- A dozen bodies in the street
- A watch member reveals it is a clash between the Xanathar and Zhentarim
- A purple shop stands out on the corner of Zastrow Street and Fillet Lane, Old Xoblob...

## Old Xoblob
- Run by a Gnome
- He's got eyes on his cheeks - possibly a gang sign
- Everything is purple
- Purple-buttoned
- The stuffed beholder outside gave off a little evil vibe
- Gained beholder memories in an explosion from a spore attack in the Undercliff
- Tried changing the name of the shop, but people kept calling it "Old Xoblob's" so he changed it back, then eventualy changed his own name
- He's mad
- He witnessed a kerfuffle outside 2 nights ago
	- Didn't recognise any of them
	- Black leather armour
	- Black tattoo of a winged snake
	- He might have seen Floon
- Leon bought the purple buttons

## The Skewered Dragon
- It's a bit of a dive
- Barkeep wasn't working 2 nights ago, pointed us to some regulars
- Floon met with Renaer Neverember, son of previous Open Lord, Dagult Neverember, after Volo
- Renaer is not popular with some of the customers, on account of his snootishness
- He frequents a warehouse with a snake symbol on the door. It's on Candle Lane.
