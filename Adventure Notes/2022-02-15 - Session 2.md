# Session 2

## Candle Lane

- Found the warehouse with the snake back of a yard with a high fence
- The gate to the courtyard is unlocked, but the main door is locked, with a sliding peephole door
- Knocking gives no response
- We broke in through the window

## In the Warehouse

- There are corpses on the east wall
- While [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] valiantly ritual-casts an alarm spell on the courthouse gate, the rest of the party foolishly wanders in and is ambushed by a group of kenku
- [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] and [[Nanny]] take a beating and go down quickly
- Two of the birds escape and [[Serge Meridian|Serge]] panics and chases the witnesses to his double-murder, but they get away

## After the Encounter

- The contents of the warehouse are just normal gang arms and armour
- Quivering under a tarpaulin is [[Renaer Neverember]]
- Ranaer revelas that he and Floon were jumped that night on the way home by the Zhentarim
- The place was raided by Xanathar's Guild and Floon was taken away by them
- Ranaer believes this was a case of mistaken identity
- [[Hyustus Staget|Captain Staget]] apprehends the two escaped kenku
- He is concerned due to our obvious involvement in the violence, but gives us the benefit of the doubt due to the fact that the victims are gang members and we did end up rescuing Ranaer ^0af1db

## Back to the Yawning Portal

- We stay for the night along with Ranaer, having a proper chat with the guy
- He reveals some details about [The Stone of Golorr](../Waterdeep/The%20Stone%20of%20Golorr.md)
- We dress him up in a rudimentary disguise, and we head for Fillet Street to look for any sewer entrances
- There are entrances to sewers around but none that show frequent use
