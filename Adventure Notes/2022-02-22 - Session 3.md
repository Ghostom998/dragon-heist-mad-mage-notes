# Session 3

## Sewers

- Just as we're about to enter the sewers, we're joined by known acquaintance [[Whitelaw]]
- We see a symbol of a wheel of spikes, a known emblem of Xanathar, with arrows pointing down a path
- Eventually, following several of these symbol + arrow combinations we come across a small beholder-ish little creature, by an intersection with a ladder nearby.
  - [[Nanny]] attempts to approach and stroke the creature, but is hit with its beam attack and pushed 30ft away
  - She approached the creature once again, but is hit by another ray that applies fear
  - One last approach by [[Nanny]], with thoughts of "tough love" in her mind. This time he succeeds in intimidating it, with a strike of rolled-up newspaper to the nose, and in turn it initiates combat.
  - [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|Colin]] and [[Leon Margaster|Leon]] intervene with a couple of attacks, and then it gets obliterated by a crit from [[Nanny]]'s rapier.
  - [[Nanny]] puts the poop-covered corpse in her bag????
- [[Whitelaw]] pokes his head out the top of the ladder, and he sees a cellar filled with kegs
  - Upon further investigation, it appears to be [[The Spouting Fish]] ^3ed5e8
- Returning to the sewers, we follow the symbols some more and come across two arrow slits with goblins behind them
- After some conversation about stealthily apprehending the goblins, we decide not to enter their quarters and choose to sneak through the regular door ahead while we're still undetected
- [[Renaer Neverember|Renaer]] sneaks through and reveals yet another arrow slit to one of the goblins
- [[Prissencolen Essen Alcuisol|Colin]] steals an arrow from the goblins in order to stab the Gazer (little beholder creature), to frame them. ![Location of the gazer corpse](gazer_corpse.png)
- We go through to a crude armoury and sneak past the goblin's room
- Next room appears to be sleeping quarters, with a thin wooden door at the end with some noise
  - There's some arguing behind the door
  - "No not like that, you've got to plug it from the bottom. Use some blankets."
  - There are a human and a duergar trying to barricade a door, with grey ooze leaking from it
  - We recognise the human as [[Krenz]]
- Entering the room, we kill the duergar and beat [[Krenz]] to submission
- [[Serge]] chucks the duergar into the ooze room to keep it busy and hide the body
- We tie up and revive [[Krenz]] to interrogate him
  - [[Floon Blagmaar|A prisoner]] is being held by [[Grum'shar]], who is currently entertaining a guest, [[Nihiloor]]
  - He makes a map for us ![Krenz's map](krenz_map.png)
- We make our way down the next corridor to what looks like a boss fight for the next session!
